                                    I am currently working on a full operating system for the ARM8 architecture, made specifically for the Raspberry PI 4B. Currently it is in its infancy, and you can find the source code for it <a href="https://github.com/stcksmsh/StrawberryOS/"> here</a>.

                                During my 4th and 5th semester, I have enrolled in the Operating Systems 1 and 2 courses. 
                                Both courses had a project that was to be done for the RISC-V architecture.
                                The OS1 project was to create a 'simple' single processor microkernel that would support multithreading, memory management, console I/O and time sharing.
                                The OS2 project was to add page swapping and thrashing detection/prevention functionality for MIT's educational <a href="https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public">xv6</a> operating system.
